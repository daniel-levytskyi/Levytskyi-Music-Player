# Levytskyi Music Player

Basically just a music player I made because VLC Media decided to be physically incapable of opening my audio and data CDs, I'm honestly surpirsed it turned out kinda well.

# Installation

Yeah, I have no clue how to use github cloning and whatever so if you want to use this, you gotta just download the libraries and copy/paste the code I guess...
